# Coffee Delivery App

Challenge proposed by Rocketseat's Ignite program, main goal is to develop a web app that lets the user choose whatever kind of coffee he wants to order.
After choosing the products, the user can type the address in a form and review his order's items and total values. 
Finally, the user is led to a success page with information regarding delivery address and time.
